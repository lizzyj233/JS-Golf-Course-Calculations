<!--This project is going to calculate the slope and rating for unrated women's tees. For example, many golf courses do not have the gold or white (senior/mens) tees rated for a woman playing from them. As a woman golfer, I am tired of manually calculting this. Let's make it easier!

The project will work like so:
    The golfer will be asked to choose whether they played 18 or 9 holes. - input A
    The golfer will be asked to input the yardage of unrated tees. - input B
    The golfer will input the yardage of the rated women's tees. - input C
    The golfer will input the slope of the rated women's tees. - input D
    The golfer will input the course rating of the rated women's tees - input E 
    A lookup will be performed to get the difference to add from the reference table. - function
    The slope and rating to use is presented to the user. - output A

    Future enhancement ideas:
        Perform an http get to pull in the ratings from the NCRDB
        Put the reference table in a json, perform lookup via JSON
        Add course handicap calculator
        Pre-load several local courses for quick reference on site load
    
    Future related project ideas:
        Course stats tracker

    <h1>Calculate the slope and rating for your unrated tees.</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project is to make it easier for women to calculate the slope & rating of tees that are not rated for women. We like a challenge, lets rate those tees!</p>
